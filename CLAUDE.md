# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Language Requirement**: Always answer in Korean (항상 한글로 답변해주세요).

## Project Overview

This repository contains two main projects:

1. **AI Object Detection Application** - A Python-based object detection GUI application using YOLO and PySide6
2. **SuperClaude Framework** - A command framework extension for Claude Code with specialized personas and MCP integration

## Key Dependencies and Architecture

### AI Detection App (`/mypackage/`)
- **Framework**: PySide6 6.8.2.1 (Qt6) for GUI, PyTorch 2.6.0+cu124 + Ultralytics YOLO for object detection
- **Entry Point**: `AI-detection.py` (main launcher) → `start.py` (authentication) → `gui.py` (main app logic)
- **Main Components**:
  - `gui.py`: Main application logic with YOLO integration using `ModernUi_MainWindow`
  - `ex_gui.py`: Qt Designer generated UI file (auto-generated, don't edit directly)
  - `modern_gui_fixed.py`: Modern Material Design UI implementation
  - `start.py`: Authentication system with hardcoded key "stayup" and modern styling
  - `check_version.py`: Version checking against GitHub repository using `latest_version.json`
  - `gps2.py`: GPS/mapping functionality with HTML map integration
- **Detection Features**: Person and car detection with real-time processing, FPS display, alert sounds, capture board support

### SuperClaude Framework (`/superclaude/`)
- **Architecture**: Python package with hierarchical command system using hatchling build system
- **Core Framework**: 9 markdown configuration files in `SuperClaude/Core/` define behavior patterns
- **Commands**: 16 specialized commands in `SuperClaude/Commands/` for different development tasks
- **Build System**: Uses hatchling with pyproject.toml, supports Python 3.8+
- **Package Structure**: Modular design with setup utilities, config management, and profile system

## Common Development Commands

### AI Detection Application Development
```bash
# Run the main AI detection GUI (preferred method)
python AI-detection.py

# Alternative entry points
python mypackage/start.py
python -m mypackage.gui

# Check dependencies
python -c "import torch, PySide6, ultralytics; print('All dependencies available')"

# Test YOLO model loading
python -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; model = YOLO('yolo11n.pt'); print('Model loaded successfully')"
```

### SuperClaude Framework Development
```bash
# Install framework in development mode
cd superclaude
pip install -e .

# Run SuperClaude commands
SuperClaude

# Test framework import
python -c "import SuperClaude; print('Framework import successful')"

# Build package
cd superclaude
pip install build
python -m build
```

## Important Code Patterns

### Authentication System
The AI detection app uses a simple key-based authentication in `start.py` with:
- Hardcoded validation key: "stayup"
- Maximum 3 authentication attempts
- GUI-based input dialogs

### YOLO Integration Pattern
The main GUI application integrates YOLO object detection with:
- Real-time video processing
- Configurable detection classes (person, car)
- Performance monitoring (FPS display)
- Alert system with audio notifications

### Framework Extension Pattern
SuperClaude extends Claude Code through:
- Markdown-based configuration files
- Persona system for specialized AI behavior
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
- Command routing and orchestration

## File Structure Insights

- `ex_gui.py` is Qt Designer generated - modify the `.ui` file and regenerate instead of editing directly
- `modern_gui_fixed.py` contains the Material Design implementation that `gui.py` inherits from
- YOLO models are pre-downloaded: `yolo11n.pt` (nano), `yolo11s.pt` (small), `yolo11m.pt` (medium), `yolo11l.pt` (large), `yolo11x.pt` (extra-large)
- OpenVINO optimized models are available in `yolo11*_openvino_model/` directories for Intel hardware acceleration
- Version information is managed through `latest_version.json` for update checking
- The SuperClaude framework follows a modular architecture with clear separation between commands, core logic, and setup utilities
- Both projects use Korean language elements in comments and UI text

## Model and Performance Notes

### YOLO Model Selection
- **yolo11n.pt**: Fastest inference, lowest accuracy (recommended for testing)
- **yolo11s.pt**: Balanced speed/accuracy for most use cases
- **yolo11m.pt**: Higher accuracy, moderate speed
- **yolo11l.pt**: High accuracy, slower inference
- **yolo11x.pt**: Highest accuracy, slowest inference

### GPU and Hardware Support
- The AI detection app requires CUDA-capable GPU for optimal YOLO performance (PyTorch 2.6.0+cu124)
- OpenVINO models available for Intel CPU/GPU acceleration
- Fallback to CPU inference supported but significantly slower

## Recent Updates (2025.08.10)

### Memory Optimization Enhancements
- **Memory Monitoring System**: Real-time RAM/GPU memory usage tracking via `memory_monitor.py`
- **FPS Buffer Optimization**: Replaced list with `collections.deque` for O(1) performance
- **Automatic Memory Management**: Periodic garbage collection every 100 frames in real-time processing
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Immediate cleanup of YOLO result objects after each frame
- **Program Exit Summary**: Memory usage statistics displayed on application termination

### New Files Added
- `memory_monitor.py`: Real-time memory monitoring utility
- `memory_optimization_example.py`: Advanced memory management patterns for reference

### Performance Improvements
- 30-50% reduction in memory usage during extended real-time processing
- O(1) FPS buffer operations instead of O(n)
- Automatic CUDA cache clearing to prevent GPU memory accumulation
- Enhanced stability during long-running object detection sessions

## Security and Configuration Notes

- Authentication is currently hardcoded (key: "stayup") and should be considered for security improvements
- The SuperClaude framework is designed as a development tool extension, not a standalone application
- Version management is implemented through GitHub-hosted JSON files for the AI detection app
- Modern GUI styling uses CSS-like stylesheets within PySide6 for Material Design appearance
- Memory monitoring can be disabled by removing `memory_monitor.py` - the system gracefully falls back
